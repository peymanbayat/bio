# streamlit-bioinf-tool
 Helpful tool that analyses DNA sequences for you

to run:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

So far it is capable of:
- analysing basic DNA sequences from text/.txt file,
- translating DNA to RNA and coded peptides
- finding mutations in a sequence from .txt file
- finding domains in a DNA sequence

Project is still ongoing, so code will be refactored and more options added.
